    "**Generative Adversarial Networks**, introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014, are neural nets we can train to _produce_ new images (or other kinds of data) that look as though they came from our true data distribution. In this notebook, we'll implement a small GAN for generating images that look as though they come from the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight behind the GAN is to pit two neural networks against each other. On the one hand is the **Generator**, a neural network that takes random noise as input and produces an image as output. On the other hand is the **Discriminator**, which takes in an image and classifies it as real (from MNIST) or fake (from our Generator). During training, we alternate between training the Generator to fool the Discriminator, and training the Discriminator to call the Generator's bluff.\n",
